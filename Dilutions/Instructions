First 24 samples go in position 10 starting at A1 then traveling to A6 and from A6 it will go to B1. 
Second 24 samples go in position 7
Third 24 samples go in position 4
Forth 24 samples go in position 1

First set of dilutions go in position 11, second set 8, third set 5, forth set 2.
The dilution positions are the same as the sample positions just moved over to the next rack.

Step 1: Create a one column csv file of all the concentrations in the order they will be placed in. The row number of this file tells the machine how many samples are present
Step 2: copy the data from this file and paste it directly below this line  " csv_raw = '''  "
Step 3: place 5ml of water in a 15ml conical tube on location 3 A1
Step 4: load samples
Step 5: Set this variable equal to your target concentration in ng/ul "target_con" (default is 10)
Step 6: Run protocol
Step 7: Close samples and dilutions. Vortex dilutions before next use.
